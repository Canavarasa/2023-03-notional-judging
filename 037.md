# Missing check against use of expired signatures in `castVoteBySig() function` found in GovernorAlpha.sol

## Summary
There is no check against usage of expired/already used signatures in the castVoteBySig() function found in GovernorAlpha.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does a good check against the `zero-address`by implementing openzeppelin's ECDSA.sol's `.recover() function`
but fails to check for usage of expired/already used signatures when voting via `castVoteBySig() function` 

## Impact
sigs can be re-used over and over again. 
This means a sig can vote as much as he wants because of missing check against expired/already used signatures.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Used signatures can be stored for example in some kind of mapping or persistent storage and then a check should be made from the `castVoteBySig() function` against the mapping to make sure the sig being used doesn't exist in the mapping.
That way already used sigs that have voted can't be reused.
