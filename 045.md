# The `approve()` function in NotionalV2BaseLiquidator.sol can be frontrun by attacker

## Summary
`approve()` function in NotionalV2BaseLiquidator.sol can be frontrun by attacker

## Vulnerability Detail
Approve  function of NotionalV2BaseLiquidator.sol is subject to front-run attack because the approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. In case the spender spent the amount, the approve function will approve a new amount.

## Impact
The approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. It allows the spender to front-run and spend the amount before the new allowance is set.
