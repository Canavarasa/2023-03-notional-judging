# unchecked return value of deposit() and transfer() in transferNativeTokenOut() function found in GenericToken.sol

## Summary
The return value of a deposit and transfer wasn't checked in transferNativeTokenOut() function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
when the user is depositing Ether into the WETH contract in exchange for wrapped Ether tokens, the user may lose Ether as the return value of deposit() isn't checked.
```solidity
 Deployments.WETH.deposit{value: amount}();
```

users that don't want to withdraw their `Native tokens` as `wrapped-Eth` will lose their native tokens in a situation where the transfer fails for unseen reasons. As the transfer tx won't be able to revert.
```solidity
  payable(account).transfer(amount);
```
## Impact
Users can lose their ETHER when depositing into the WETH contract in exchange for wrapped-ether as the return value of deposit() isn't checked, In a situation where the deposit fails.

Users can lose their Native Tokens if they don't want to wrap the native token (i.e WETH) and transfer it as an ERC20, because the function transferNativeTokenOut() uses transfer() method to transfer the native tokens but doesn't check it's return values.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
pls check the return value of this deposit
```solidity
            Deployments.WETH.deposit{value: amount}();
```
and this  transfer also 
```solidity
            payable(account).transfer(amount);
```
and ensure it reverts on failure.
