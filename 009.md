# unchecked return value of transfer() in transferNativeTokenOut() function found in GenericToken.sol

## Summary
The return value of a transfer wasn't checked in transferNativeTokenOut() function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
users that don't want to withdraw their `Native tokens` as `wrapped-Eth` will lose their native tokens in a situation where the transfer fails for unseen reasons. As the transfer tx won't be able to revert.

## Impact
Users can lose their Native Tokens if they don't want to wrap the native token (i.e WETH) and transfer it as an ERC20, because the function transferNativeTokenOut() uses transfer() method to transfer the native tokens but doesn't check it's return values.

```solidity
            payable(account).transfer(amount);
```
and ensure it reverts on failure.
