# unchecked return value of transfer()

## Summary
The return value of a transfer wasn't checked in withdraw() function found in NotionalV2FlashLiquidator.sol. 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
  IERC20(token).transfer(owner, amount);
```
## Impact
users can lose their token due to unchecked return value of transfer()
