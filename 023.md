## Summary
using .transfer() method to transfer funds can freeze funds in smart contracts

## Vulnerability Detail
this method 
```solidity
 payable(account).transfer(amount);
```
was used to transfer funds for those that don't want to wrap their tokens in `function transferNativeTokenOut()` found in GenericToken.sol.

But:

2) opcode gas pricing can change in future version of Ethereum, and your contract will break.
