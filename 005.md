# BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L102.initialize() function will not work for some tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount

## Summary
The BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L102.initialize() function will not work for some tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L102.initialize() function approves token spending from IERC20(underlying) to address(NOTIONAL) in amount type(uint256).max.

There are tokens that don't support approve spender type(uint256).max amount. So the BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L102.initialize() function will not work for some tokens like UNI or COMP which will revert when approve type(uint256).max amount.

Based on the project document, Any Non-Rebasing token can get use in this project.

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: Currently Mainnet, considering Arbitrum and Optimisim in the near future.
ERC20:  Any Non-Rebasing token. ex. USDC, DAI, USDT (future), wstETH, WETH, WBTC, FRAX, CRV, etc.
ERC721: None
ERC777: None
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: None planned, some support for fee on transfer
```
## Impact
Tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount could not be used in BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L102.initialize() function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would suggest approve only the necessay amount of token to the approveTarget instead of the type(uint256).max amount.
