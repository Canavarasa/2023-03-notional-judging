# Reentrancy will get more fcash than deposited CalculationViews.sol

## Summary
There is a reentrancy vulnerability in the function named getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal. Within the getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal function there are deposit and withdraw functions named _convertDepositAmountToUnderlyingInternal and _getfCashAmountGivenCashAmount. By creating an attack contract one could deposit into the contract and then use reentrancy to withdraw more than they deposited into the account. Use re-entrancy guard and place the require statement above the update statement as follows.
## Vulnerability Detail
Vulnerability on lines 372 to 380
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/CalculationViews.sol#L360-L386
## Impact
By creating an attack contract one could deposit into the contract and then use reentrancy to withdraw more than they deposited into the account.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal(
        uint16 currencyId,
        uint256 borrowedAmountExternal,
        uint256 maturity,
        uint32 maxBorrowRate,
        uint256 blockTime,
        bool useUnderlying
    ) external view override returns (
        uint88 fCashDebt,
        uint8 marketIndex,
        bytes32 encodedTrade
    ) {
        marketIndex = getMarketIndex(maturity, blockTime);
        require(marketIndex > 0);

        (
            int256 underlyingInternal,
            CashGroupParameters memory cashGroup
        ) = _convertDepositAmountToUnderlyingInternal(currencyId, borrowedAmountExternal, useUnderlying);
        int256 fCash = _getfCashAmountGivenCashAmount(underlyingInternal.toInt88(), marketIndex, blockTime, cashGroup);
        require(fCash < 0);

        (
            encodedTrade,
            fCashDebt
        ) = _encodeLendBorrowTrade(TradeActionType.Borrow, marketIndex, fCash, maxBorrowRate);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
use re-entrancy guard and place the require statement above the update statement as follows.
```solidity
require(marketIndex > 0);
marketIndex = getMarketIndex(maturity, blockTime);
```
