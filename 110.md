# call data to enter or exit market is never generated

## Summary
call data to enter or exit market is never generated
## Vulnerability Detail
the function `getDepositCalldata` never generates calldata for entering an exiting compounds markets, this can be observed in the snippet below
```solidity
function getDepositCalldata(
        address from,
        address assetToken,
        address assetRateAdapter,
        uint256 rateAdapterPrecision,
        uint256 depositUnderlyingAmount,
        bool underlyingIsETH
    ) internal view returns (DepositData[] memory data) {
        address[] memory targets = new address[](1);
        bytes[] memory callData = new bytes[](1);
        uint256[] memory msgValue = new uint256[](1);

        targets[0] = assetToken;
        msgValue[0] = underlyingIsETH ? depositUnderlyingAmount : 0;
        callData[0] = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            underlyingIsETH ? CEtherInterface.mint.selector : CErc20Interface.mint.selector, 
            depositUnderlyingAmount
        );

        data = new DepositData[](1);
        data[0] = DepositData(targets, callData, msgValue, depositUnderlyingAmount, assetToken);
    }
```
since no calldata for entering and exiting the compound markets is ever generated, it is impossible to enter the market rendering the function useless. Users of the protocol will be unable to correctly enter markets because of this
## Impact
Function will not work as intended, users will lose trust in the protocol this will ultimately lead to loss of potential funds for the protocol.

## Recommendation
We recommend generating calldata to enter and exit markets
