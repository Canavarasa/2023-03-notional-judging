# usage of single-step transfer of guardian is risky

## Summary
Single-step process for guardianship transfer is risky due to possible human error which could result in locking all the functions that use the onlyGuardian modifier

## Vulnerability Detail
Human error is possible when transferring roles.
I believe this transfer of guardianship is similar to transfer of ownership.
A single-step process for changing/renouncing roles in general is risky due to a possible human error and such an error is unrecoverable. For example, an incorrect address, for which the private key is not known, could be passed accidentally.

## Impact
things could go wrong when transferring roles, so its better to use a 2 step process to change roles.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

   1. Approve a new address as a pendingGuardian
    2. A transaction from the pendingGuardian address claims the pending guardianship change.

This mitigates the risk because if an incorrect address is used in step (1) then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step (1) can step (2) happen and complete the ownership change.
