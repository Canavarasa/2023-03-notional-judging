# Prime cash underlying AAVE tokens can cause Notionals' token accounting stuck

## Summary
Since AAVEs' aTokens are rebased in nature, accounting inside the notional contracts can cause Notional to account wrongly.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here's a modified version with corrected grammar and phrasing:

Let's take a look at an example to better understand the issue. Assume that at t=0, governance rebalanced the underlying prime cash and deposited 100 DAI into Aave, resulting in 100 aDAI. Notional storage holds 100 aDAI at this point.

Assuming that 100 pDAI equals 100 DAI at t=0, after some time has passed (t=1), 100pDAI is now worth 102 aDAI, which is equivalent to 102 DAI. This growth in underlying value is expected.

If a user withdraws the 100 pDAI, they should receive 102 DAI as the underlying amount. However, when the user calls the withdraw function, Notional begins the redemption of the 102 DAI. Since there are no idle DAI in Notional, the following values are used:

oldAssetBalance = 102 aDAI
newAssetBalance = 0 aDAI
storedBalance = 100 aDAI
When calculating the new stored token balance, the following formula is used:

netBalanceChange = 0 - 102 = -102
store[token] = 100 + (-102) = -2
This value will cause a revert due to the safeInt function.

## Impact
Although the protocol team states that rebasing tokens will not be used, they also claim to use AAVE's aTokens which are rebasing. Assuming they will use AAVE this issue should be valid. 

When protocol team states that they don't want to use rebasing tokens I am assuming they meant the currency Notional will accept will not be rebasing (DAI-USDC-USDT as currencies not aUSDT or any rebasing token)
