# TokenHandler.safeTransferOut & TokenHandler.safeTransferIn does not work on non-standard compliant tokens like USDT(which the protocol plans to introduce in the future)

## Summary
TokenHandler.safeTransferOut & TokenHandler.safeTransferOut does not work on non-standard compliant tokens like USDT(which the protocol plans to introduce in the future)

## Vulnerability Detail
I chose to report this as this will be bad when the protocol later introduces tokens like usdt. It will cost them much to rectify the mistake then because they'll have to redeploy.
I also confirmed from Jeff wu and he gave me a go ahead.

The TokenHandler.safeTransferOut function and TokenHandler.safeTransferIn function uses the standard IERC20 function for the transfer call and proceeds with a checkReturnCode function to handle non-standard compliant tokens that don't return a return value.
However, this does not work as calling token.transfer(account, amount) already reverts if the token does not return a return value, as token's IERC20.transfer is defined to always return a boolean.

## Impact
When using any non-standard compliant token like USDT, the function will revert.
Deposits for these tokens are broken.

## Recommendation
I recommend using [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the safeApprove function that handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
