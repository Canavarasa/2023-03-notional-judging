# DOS by Frontrunning NoteERC20 initialize() Function

## Summary
DOS by Frontrunning NoteERC20 initialize() Function

## Vulnerability Detail
The scripts/ folder outlines a number of deployment scripts used by the Notional team. Some of the contracts deployed utilise the ERC1967 upgradeable proxy standard. This standard involves first deploying an implementation contract and later a proxy contract which uses the implementation contract as its logic. When users make calls to the proxy contract, the proxy contract will delegate call to the underlying implementation contract. NoteERC20.sol and Router.sol both implement an initialize() function which aims to replace the role of the constructor() when deploying proxy contracts. It is important that these proxy contracts are deployed and initialized in the same transaction to avoid any malicious frontrunning. However, scripts/deployment.py does not follow this pattern when deploying NoteERC20.sol's proxy contract. As a result, a malicious attacker could monitor the Ethereum blockchain for bytecode that matches the NoteERC20 contract and frontrun the initialize() transaction to gain ownership of the contract. This can be repeated as a Denial Of Service (DOS) type of attack, effectively preventing Notional's contract deployment, leading to unrecoverable gas expenses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As the GovernanceAlpha.sol and NoteERC20.sol are co-dependent contracts in terms of deployment, it won't be possible to deploy the governance contract before deploying and initializing the token contract. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to ensure the NoteERC20.sol proxy contract is deployed and initialized in the same transaction, or ensure the initialize() function is callable only by the deployer of the NoteERC20.sol contract. This could be set in the proxy contracts constructor().
