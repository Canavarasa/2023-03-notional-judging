# Compound exchange rate can be manipulated to withdraw more underlying tokens from NotionalV3

## Summary
Prime cash underlying values can be manipulated via donating the underlying to cToken contract to inflate the cToken price and then withdrawing from Notional for more.
## Vulnerability Detail
Prime supply underlying value is calculated via few formulas and math operations let's check them:

To calculate the underlying interest rate:
(currentUnderlyingValue - lastUnderlyingValue) / lastUnderlyingValue
which we can say that underlying value can be in forms of DAI or cDAI (since the other protocol handlers are not in the audit scope I'll treat it as there is only CompoundV2 available for prime cash external lenders)
We can derive this formula for more context:
(((exchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds) - ((previousExchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds)) / ((previousExchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds) = underlyingInterestRate

To calculate the underlying scalar:
lastScalar * (1 + underlyingInterestRate) = underlyingScalar

To calculate the supply factor:
supplyScalar * underlyingScalar = supplyFactor

To calculate the underlying final:
primeCashValue * supplyFactor = underlyingFinal

now considering these, if someone can manipulate the currentUnderlying (total underlying tokens that Notional holds) up to some level that they can benefit. Currently, NotionalV3 deposits the funds to CompoundV2 which the exchange rate is calculated as follows:

(totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalCDAISupply

where as totalCash is the balanceOf(token) in the cToken contract. This means that the donations can manipulate the exchange rate and make Notional V3 underlying oracle trick that the tokens worths more. That means the exchange rate can be calculated as this:

(airDropAmount + totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalCDAISupply

if we can find a scenario where underlyingFinal > airDropAmount, someone with a existed pDAI can withdraw more than the airdrop amount and make a profit. 


Let's draw a scenario where this can happen ,
1- totalAssetTokens are 1B == 1B primeSupply to start with (after migration totalCDAI == totalPrimeSupply) 
2- Alice (attacker) deposits 10M DAI and receives 10M pDAI (no interest accrued so 1:1 with deposits)
3- Some others also deposits 5M DAI and they also receive 5M pDAI (no interest accrued so 1:1 with deposits)
Now Alice can flash loan 10M DAI and airdrop to cDAI contract and withdraw her 10M pDAI for more than 10M which will be proven in this math scenario.

Let's provide an numerical example, for realistic purposes I'll take the current cDAI stats (totalBorrows, totalReserves, totalCDAISupply, cashBalance) and will assume the supplyScalar = 1 (interest not accrued, assume we are in beginning of after migration)

Given:

airdropAmount = 10M DAI
cashBalance = 148M DAI
totalBorrows = 175.7M DAI
totalReserves = 2.2M DAI
totalCDAISupply = approximately 12.89B cDAI
totalCDAIHoldings = 1B cDAI (This is how much Notional holds, approx 20M DAI) 
totalDAIHolds = 15M DAI (This is how much Notional holds as idle DAI)
First, calculate the previous exchange rate:

previousExchangeRate = (cashBalance + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalCDAISupply
= (148M DAI + 175.7M DAI - 2.2M DAI) / 12.89B cDAI
= 0.025 DAI/cDAI (approx)

Now, calculate the new exchange rate after the airdrop:

exchangeRate = (airdropAmount + cashBalance + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalCDAISupply
= (10M DAI + 148M DAI + 175.7M DAI - 2.2M DAI) / 12.89B cDAI
= 0.0258 DAI/cDAI (approx)

Now, calculate the underlying interest rate:

underlyingInterestRate = (((exchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds) - ((previousExchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds)) / ((previousExchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds)
= (((0.0258 DAI/cDAI * 1B cDAI) + 15M DAI) - ((0.025 DAI/cDAI * 1B cDAI) + 15M DAI)) / ((0.025 DAI/cDAI * 1B cDAI) + 15M DAI)
= 0.032 (approx)

Now, calculate the underlying scalar assuming lastScalar = 1:

underlyingScalar = lastScalar * (1 + underlyingInterestRate)
= 1 * (1 + 0.032)
= 1.032

Assuming supplyScalar = 1, calculate the supply factor:

supplyFactor = supplyScalar * underlyingScalar
= 1 * 1.032
= 1.032

Finally, assuming primeCashValue = 10M pDAI, calculate the underlying final:

underlyingFinal = primeCashValue * supplyFactor
= 10M * 1.032
= 10.32M DAI

So, after the airdrop, the total amount of DAI that Alice can get for redeeming 10M pDAI would worth around 10.32M DAI, which is a profit of approximately 0.32M DAI or 320,000 DAI.

Now when Alice tries to withdraw 10.32M DAI since the Notional has 15M DAI as idle it will not do any redemption and Alice will receive the 10.32M DAI.

Note: supplyScalar and lastScalar does not really have any effect to this exploit, for simplicity I took them as 1 (which will be the initial value for them).

## Impact
Although the above example done with big numbers this attack type is viable as long as the idle DAI balance existed in the NotionalV3 and the attacker has a prime cash value before the flash loan manipulation. Profit depends on few factors such as the total underlying notional holds, total prime cash the attacker has and the cDAI exchange rate. Most of the time attacker will have a profitable scenario, attacker can also do the above attack with smaller amounts if attacker does not have 10M DAI to deposit for 10M pDAI at the beginning and achieve the same result.
