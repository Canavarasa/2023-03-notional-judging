# Treasury cannot claim COMP tokens & COMP tokens can be stuck

## Summary
Treasury cannot claim COMP tokens & COMP tokens can be stuck
## Vulnerability Detail
The `TreasuryAction.claimCOMPAndTransfer` function uses pre- and post-balances of the COMP token to check which ones to transfer:

```solidity
(address[] calldata cTokens)
        external
        override
        onlyManagerContract
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 balanceBefore = COMP.balanceOf(address(this));
        COMPTROLLER.claimComp(address(this), cTokens);
        uint256 balanceAfter = COMP.balanceOf(address(this));


        // NOTE: the onlyManagerContract modifier prevents a transfer to address(0) here
        uint256 netBalance = balanceAfter.sub(balanceBefore);
        if (netBalance > 0) {
            COMP.safeTransfer(msg.sender, netBalance);
        }


        // NOTE: TreasuryManager contract will emit a COMPHarvested event
        return netBalance;
    }
```
Note that anyone can claim COMP tokens on behalf of any address (see [Comptroller.claimComp](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1328)).
An attacker can claim COMP tokens on behalf of the contract and it'll never be able to claim any compound itself.
The COMP claimed by the attacker are stuck in the contract and cannot be retrieved.
(One can eventually get back the stuck COMP by creating a cCOMP market and then transferring it through transferReserveToTreasury.)

## Impact
An attacker can claim COMP tokens on behalf of the contract and it'll never be able to claim any compound itself.
The COMP claimed by the attacker are stuck in the contract and cannot be retrieved.

## Recommendation
Don't use pre-and post-balances, try to use the entire balance instead.
