# The `_executeDexTrade()` doesn't ensure the `deadline` specified isn't bypassed

## Summary
The `_executeDexTrade()` doesn't ensure the `deadline` specified isn't bypassed
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_executeDexTrade()` doesn't ensure the `deadline` specified isn't bypassed, the transactions can potentially remain pending indefinitely, if there are network issues or other problems.

## Impact
it may be beneficial to have the _executeDexTrade() function  check the specified `deadline` to ensure that the transaction is completed within a reasonable amount of time, because the transaction can potentially remain pending indefinitely, if there are network issues or other problems.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _executeDexTrade(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        bytes memory params
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // prettier-ignore
        (
            bytes memory path,
            uint256 deadline
        ) = abi.decode(params, (bytes, uint256));

        ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory swapParams = ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams(
            path,
            address(this),
            deadline,
            amountIn,
            amountOutMin
        );

       return ISwapRouter(EXCHANGE).exactInput(swapParams);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Pls have the _executeDexTrade() function check the specified deadline and ensure a revert when it's exceeded.
