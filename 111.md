# cToken mint/redeem return value is never handled

## Summary
cToken mint/redeem return value is never handled
## Vulnerability Detail
the cToken mint/redeem return value is never handled
```solidity

  for (uint256 j; j < depositData.targets.length; ++j) {
                // This will revert if the individual call reverts.
                GenericToken.executeLowLevelCall(
                    depositData.targets[j], 
                    depositData.msgValue[j], 
                    depositData.callData[j]
                );
            }
```
in the snippet above we see that there is no where in the logic where the return value is ever checked.

this is a problem because any protocol who may want to integrate with notional will need to handle return values. Because those values are never checked, functions may be at risk of reverting silently
## Impact
There may be problems with protocols who want to integrate with notional, functions may fail silently. This could lead to loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend to add logic to the function which handles the return values
