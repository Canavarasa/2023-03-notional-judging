# Missing getLendingPool function breaks external protocol integration

## Summary
`getLendingPool` function is missing
## Vulnerability Detail
`getLendingPool` is missing from the protocol. The function was removed with the addition of notional v3 and currently is not included in the protocol
## Impact
The `getLendingPool` is neccesary and because the protocol currently does not include it, this may break integration with other protocols. Protocols who attempt to call this missing function will be left with a revert.
## Code Snippet
N/A
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend that the protocol adds the `getLendingPool` function.
