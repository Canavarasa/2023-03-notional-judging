# Potential DOS in Contracts Inheriting UUPSUpgradeable.sol

## Summary
Potential DOS in Contracts Inheriting UUPSUpgradeable.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
There are a number of contracts which inherit UUPSUpgradeable.sol, namely; GovernanceAction.sol, PauseRouter.sol and NoteERC20.sol. All these contracts are deployed using a proxy pattern whereby the implementation contract is used by the proxy contract for all its logic. The proxy contract will make delegate calls to the implementation contract. This helps to facilitate future upgrades by pointing the proxy contract to a new and upgraded implementation contract. However, if the implementation contract is left uninitialized, it is possible for any user to gain ownership of the onlyOwner role in the implementation contract for NoteERC20.sol. Once the user has ownership they are able to perform an upgrade of the implementation contract's logic contract and delegate call into any arbitrary contract, allowing them to self-destruct the proxy's implementation contract. Consequently, this will prevent all NoteERC20.sol interactions until a new implementation contract is deployed.

## Impact
Initial information about this issue was found [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301).

Consider the following scenario:

- Notional finance deploys their contracts using their deployment scripts. These deployment scripts leave the implementation contracts uninitialized. Specifically the contract in question is NoteERC20.sol.

- This allows any arbitrary user to call initialize() on the NoteERC20.sol implementation contract.

- Once a user has gained control over NoteERC20.sol's implementation contract, they can bypass the _authorizeUpgrade check used to restrict upgrades to the onlyOwner role.

- The malicious user then calls UUPSUpgradeable.upgradeToAndCall() shown [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L40-L43) which in turn calls [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Upgrade.sol#L79-L107) function. The new implementation contract then points to their own contract containing a self-destruct call in its fallback function.

- As a result, the implementation contract will be self-destructed due the user controlled delegate call shown [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/8d633cb7d169f2f8595b273660b00b69e845c2fe/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L180-L187), preventing all future calls to the NoteERC20.sol proxy contract until a new implementation contract has been deployed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider initializing the implementation contract for NoteERC20.sol and checking the correct permissions before deploying the proxy contract or performing any contract upgrades. This will help to ensure the implementation contract cannot be self-destructed.
