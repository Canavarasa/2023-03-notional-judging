# using .transfer() method to transfer funds can freeze funds in smart contracts

## Summary
using .transfer() method to transfer funds can freeze funds in smart contracts

I know the devs used `.transfer()` method to mitigate reentrancy but there are others ways to mitigate reentrancy (_pls check my mitigation for that_) . 
please devs and judges should thoughtfully consider my point, because i have seen this method freeze funds before on zksync chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
this method 
```solidity
 payable(account).transfer(amount);
```
was used to transfer funds for those that don't want to wrap their tokens in `function transferNativeTokenOut()` found in GenericToken.sol.

But pls consider this:
1) fallback() function can consume more than 2300 gas( remember .transfer() has 2300 gas limit hardcoded in it), 
2) opcode gas pricing can change in future version of Ethereum, and your contract will break.

## Impact
using .transfer() method to transfer funds can freeze funds in smart contract. 
please use .call() instead.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
please use .call() instead and specify a better gas limit that should be suitable.. You can also implement a `Lock` modifier on the function to help mitigate reentrancy.
