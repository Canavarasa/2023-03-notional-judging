# Single-step process for critical ownership transfer in NotionalV2ManualLiquidator.sol is risky

## Summary
Single-step process for critical ownership transfer is risky due to possible human error which could result in locking all the functions that use the onlyOwner modifier

## Vulnerability Detail
A single-step process for changing/renouncing ownership is risky due to a possible human error and such an error is unrecoverable. For example, an incorrect address, for which the private key is not known, could be passed accidentally.

## Impact
All function that depend on the owner will unaccessible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

  1.  Approve a new address as a pendingOwner
  2.  A transaction from the pendingOwner address claims the pending ownership change.

This mitigates the risk because if an incorrect address is used in step (1) then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step (1) can step (2) happen and complete the ownership change.
